<h1>Big Burger 🍔</h1>

Big-Burger is a static web application designed as a landing site for a burger restaurant. It includes pages for the home, about the restaurant, menu items, customer testimonials, contact information, and a checkout process. The site emphasizes a clean, modern UI with responsive design to ensure it works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
The cart functionality allows users to add items from the menu, view their selections, and proceed to checkout. No backend server is required, making it ideal for quick hosting on platforms like GitHub Pages.
This project is open source and serves as a beginner-friendly example of building a multi-page website without frameworks.
